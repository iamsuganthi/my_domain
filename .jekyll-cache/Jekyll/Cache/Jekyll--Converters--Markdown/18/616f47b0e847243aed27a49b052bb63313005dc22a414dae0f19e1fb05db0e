I"œ<p>On a pleasant evening, I met Aakriti sitting alone under a tree and enjoying the beauty of Sunset. I sat next to her and started cracking lame jokes. Her reactions were so unusual and it forced me to ask her â€œAre you alright?â€. She stared at me for a second and asked me if I had loved someone. Before I could reply, a teardrop rolled down her eyes. Her boyfriend broke up with her before a few days.</p>
