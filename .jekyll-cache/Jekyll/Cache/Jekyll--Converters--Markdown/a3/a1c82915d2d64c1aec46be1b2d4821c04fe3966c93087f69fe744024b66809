It happened an year ago. I said <em>Sayounara</em> to my car and came home from school with my best buddy,Archana in her black scooty pep+. I am a rash rider.<br />

But within a minute, it started raining heavily. We dint want to wait. We wanted to have some fun. I was riding the vehicle at 40 kmph on the National Highways on that day. As usual, Archu was slapping me and screaming â€œSuganthiâ€¦ Go slow!!â€. I dint give a damn to it. Actually,Archu was too happy with the ride. But she was a little scared. We happened to see one of our schoolmates in front of his house. We howled and shouted â€œBYEâ€ to him. We were singing songs on the road. We reached home entirely drenched in rain. My mom was shocked on seeing us. She was wondering for a moment,thinking who these people are. Our white uniform was entirely spoilt! It became brown in color.</p>
